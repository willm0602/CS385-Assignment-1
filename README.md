# CS385-Assignment-1

When I was looking for a webgl project I found the site listed below that
serves as a sort of tribute to the last 20 years of the XBox console being
around. I appreciated that they had set up a 3d design with the consoles but
also had interactive UI elements throughout the design which I thought was cool.
For example, in the opening, there are logos that expand when hovering over them.
It was also interactive letting you walk around the museum.
